# youtube_comment_translate

if you spend a lot of time on youtube, and you want to interact with other viewers, maybe you will come across some comments in various foreign languages and you don't understand what they mean. 

Of course you can translate it with google translate, but it's done manually and you'll probably get tired every time you do it. or you can also translate the entire youtube page, but this is not fun because you can't see the original comments of each audience who have various languages, you also can't respect and appreciate them by replying or commenting in their native language because it's already done translated. 

this chrome extension will bring up the translate button in every comment from the viewer, and when you want to reply you can also directly translate it according to their language. this method still uses google translate, it's just that it's easier and you don't have to worry about changing pages from youtube to google translate every time you want to read or comment. you can use it for free, if you like it I hope you are willing to subscribe to my channel.

this extension works with chrome,edge and opera browser
